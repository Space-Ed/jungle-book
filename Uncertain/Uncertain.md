- Can a crux have multiple contacts
- Will a crux be invertable if it is allowed many contacts
- Can a membrane be forwarded such that it has multiple designators. Therefore requiring distribution of change notification. 
- How is the difference between confided and exposed managed? 
	- Double membrane
	- Fowarded internal designation
	- Bilocated membrane.
	
	The essense of this problem is the hard problem of restricting the actual referencing path to a single in reference or tree structure, but requiring a number of potential locations of expression.

	our shell contains cruxes marked to appear in certain contexts
		within the parent(confided)
		outside the parent(exposed)

	different structures have different default marking. this makes it unclear which is the primary reference path. Both must refer to a different subset of exposed cruxes, but.. only one should have the recursive designation. 

In a weave, where nothing is exposed by default we would add the actual deeply designable object to the mesh(internal) and then selectively forward ports to the outer context. 

In a synth, where everything is exposed by default, we would add the actual submembrane to the outside, except for when the cruxes are confided. in which case they are forwarded back to a virtual/shallow membrane on the inside.. 

This later case is the strange one because it is looping back around to the inside from the outside, alternatively we could forward from the inside to the outside, just like we would explicitly do for the weave, except the rule must be exclusionary and deep (not currently possible). Moreover the forward must create a virtual membrane, that could be confusing.


### Cap linking rules
do they:
- imparatively set the contact to be capped, thereby breaking declaritive/incremental permutability of rule application
- actually they reject the supposition of other rules, and if those rules are also capping, this is an error. 
- other sources of capping are hooks, exclusive to medium.
- is it a designation stopper(Membrane), a supposition stopper(Mesh) or a connection stopper(Medium)?
	it must be where the presence of other rules is sensed and also can wrap the entirety of the rule creation. so it is mesh and medium, for the cap rule, but after that it is not designable? But it must be designable so that other attempts to cap can collide. 
It is concievable that we would want to grant priority to claim the contact.
	- number of bars
	- being first in the rule list
	- being asserted
