This is an advanced and powerful feature of the cellular construction system. It is essentially the ability for the implementation of a cell to change without detaching in the external context and its internal component. These two cases explored seperately are the essence of dynamic form. 

### External Swap

The reason this is actually possible is because of the bilayer membrane. That means that although the inner membrane may be taken down the outer one may be left in-tact. 

implementation 1 
It would be done by detaching the shell from the lining, then reconstructing the lining and then reattaching it do the shell and then rebalancing the contacts. 

implementation 2
the messages that would notify about the change are held back until the new state is reached and then only the difference is reported, meanwhile the shell and lining are both repopulated.


This is not without it's issues
- What if the construction of the outer one depends on the inner and they cant just be repaired

- What if the prime of the hotswapped cell takes time, and the outside appears to still be communicable?
- What is the cost of reattaching links, is that really less thann the cost of rebalancing.
- what is the 

The essential issue is that there is possibly bi directional references.

the extra requirement for contacts are therefore
- must be detachable and reattachable to its partner.
- must only be configured by this attachment. 
- must be agnostic about who attaches to who first. 
- must not fail ordinary behaviour in detached state. 
- must not be able to reach state that is not recovered by reattachment. 


### Internal Swap

This is made possible only when the changable aspects of the form are permutable with respect to the addition of child components to achieve the same results. 

This requirement though easy said it no small fish. Form is essentially construction and it is often seen as something that happens before the addition of components and that paves the way for the differences. it is considered to be the static component of the cell

The rules about connection have long been the topic of interest here, that being the ability to modify the rule set without completely reconnecting everything. In this way a rule is treated as a kind of construction. 

This may work for the rules operating on a mesh made to be much more flexible, perhaps a different implementation that favours the case of direct linking for graphically connected systems. 

but there is the matter of sections, the creation of a section is not permutable with respect to creation of construct because the addition of a membrane to a space creates a tide of awaereness events. Those events have effects, if those events were screened by a section then they would never have happened. Idelly this is covered by the reversability principle but of course, once we are in operation space, the damage is done. More concisely it is the problem of movement as deletion and recreation. 

if it is asserted that form preceeds the creation of components then to change the form reliably all components must be removed and readded with the updated form. That is what you call a hard reset. Such a move is pretty much an external hotswap, you could be changing the entire specification to a new basis and patch. 

The advantage of a soft swap is that it allows for the aggregation of many changes into a single data point, that is useful for achieving modes of operation that leave components in place but changes the essence of how they are put together. 
 
This could be done at a granular level when the mode shift is reversible that means modifications remember the diff to the extracted form or the whole state of the component is remembered. But also if there is any change in form then that must be a permutable change with the existing components, back to where we started. In that sense a mode can really be conceived of as a mere extention of the pattern. 

Enough ping-pong, this is a hard problem, rudimentary implementation will see an internal swap as a hard reset that must reset all components, while the operational modification of interconnectedneess rules will be tackled as a new construct and the creation of sections considered essential to a format of a cell that is unchanged during it's life.
