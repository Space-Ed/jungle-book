# Terminology

in order to create new ideas, that are subtly different to the existing suite of Ideas it is a requirement to create some new language, and also to disambiguate the use of old language. Generally it is best to avoid speaking of worn out terms such as "node","class" and "objects" except explicitly in their original contexts.
