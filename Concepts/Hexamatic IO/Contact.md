A contact is an object that rests on the outer surface of the membrane, and is designable by a designation string. It represents a point of exposure that can be joined onto other things. 

A callback function is an example of a contact, that can be joined onto another kind of contact, that is a callable. The contact is only able to communicate it's occupied(capped) status, whether this link takes place and how it takes place are the roles of a [Mesh](Mesh.md) and [Medium](Medium.md) respectively.
