The cafe is the space, containing humans filling various roles, most broadly being the staff and customers.  so the cafe is a cell and from the door is permitted these other cells(the people), there are tables chairs lights windows the counter, coffee machine and all the vessels.

The gazes met, the conversations drifting by amidst a bleasing ambience of roots music and clang of glasses. Every sense that I have is a point of contact with my world, and within each sense is the ability to percieve some messages from my environment. As I scan the room, I see potentialities for engagement, not all of which will be expected.
