# Visors

Visors are the means by which a section of a membrane is virtualised as a seperate entity while retaining the actual containment of cruxes to a single membrane. Allowing for membranes to be virtually forwarded to different membranes. Primarily so that exposure can be managed at 

it relates to the system for adding a subrane to another membrane, now also you can add a visor.

A visor is created by designation upon a membrane, that will create a section of the membrane from those cruxes designated that now can only be accessed through the visor. 

with regards to notifications we only notify down the channel that can be designated the visor. For cruxes this means only one visor can be selected, for membranes it is possible to be designable from many locations. Only if provably all of the cruxes of a membrane were to be visored or all were not would we be able to split either way. Initially it would make sense to just do both. 

Visors would be considered immutable and will not require referrability, they would be created in the context of their use.

### Development Requirement

Creation of negative designators, so you get a visor of everything but some selection.

Creation of grouped designators/partial wild. Such developments could be of use for capturing patterns of visoring.

### Advanced
it could be concieved that a rift is effectively a membrane in a crux, that would mean visoring by rules  from within a mesh could create powerful ability to channel whole interfaces.
