## There are 4 fundamental aspects of a system

1) Form 
2) Context 
3) Composition 
4) Others

and these structural relations

1) Self
2) Parent
3) Child
4) Sibling

that creates a wealth of mantras 
1) I am an organism (a human)
2) I am part of an organism (society)
3) I am composed of Organisms (cells)
4) there are other Organisms like me (other humans)

when it is so clear that these relations are not arbitrary, why have they not been elegantly formalised in the core of a programming language? Maybe they have been..

Many systems have a notion of a global tree object that everything in existance may be somehow referenced from but this is only one way that links form, there is no difference in being referenced by our structural parent and some other thing. there is no generic way to create relationships between the entites present in a system.

In jungle these relationships are built in to the core abstractions of the language, 

## Being

The nature of being is captured in jungle with the notion of a basis, every type of construct is derived from a core type that holds the implementation and argumentation regarding the nature of the construct. Perhaps Constructs can be called Organs, they are the not always such
