## Jungle in the e-learning space.

The field of education is one that is highly complex and modularised and involves a huge amount of data and interaction. It is therefore a candidate for a jungle domain to create a platform that takes the tricky parts out of the development while allowing you to build a diverse range of learning experiences. There are many platforms that exist for e-learning already, why add more complexity to the situation. One might point at the fact that technology is no replacement for genuine interaction, it is only an aid. Potentially it enables new forms of interaction at a greater level of retention and effectiveness delivering to more people, but it is still the interaction, of course. Let us focus on the relationship between a teacher and a learner, this relationship is usually many to one at any one time, the reason for this is because teaching is a scarce resource that can be distributed within a space, but this is not where the most effective learning takes place. Ideally we have a 1:1 connection where the feedback allows the student to be targeted in their level of understanding that is many dimensional and unique to them. So what is the best model for exposing students to the right forms of interaction that will help them to develop? is it actually with their peers, outside of the scool system? how do we use technology to make more, better interaction feasible? 



### Learning Avatar

The digital self is here in force, but in social media it is optimised to make advertising revenue, not to give a learner a sense of achievement for their progress in learning. The learning avatar is a way for the learner to navagate the universe of educational experiences and to reward cumulatively for the engagement they show through formative assessment. The tracking of goals both  institutional and self given can mean the teacher is aware of where every learner is at without remembering each one. 

### Learning Spaces

The classroom is the classic learning space,  But of course there are others, from labs and workshops to offices and dance studios. Indeed almost and conceivable setting can be as opportunity to grow understanding. With the advent of digital technology the space is not limited to a physical location. All that defines the space is that it is where one is located, along with others, and there is a world to observe and discuss. and the learner is able to contribute their insight and findings back to the group.

#### Location

A learning avatar should be focused in a particular subject matter, it is their goal not to regurgitate pointed questions most effectively, but to narrow to an achievable scope to form a perspective on. The learner is located there by design, because it is a common module all must achieve or it is an allocated topic or it is chosen by the learner. A learning location is not limited to the walls of the classroom, it could be a whole school, or the whole world, forming the perspective on the matter. 

#### Peers

Peer interaction is the way that academics validate their theories, once you are at the top level there is no highest authority. This could be carried all the way down to the student level, considering of course that children may not always behave appropriately that could need intervention by the teacher, but that is all in the parameters. The students interactions with each other gives the exercise purpose it would otherwise lack.

#### Subject Matter\(World\)

The learning space is aimed at a particular topic, ahead of time there may be a curated set of resources present in the space and the possibility to add more. The students may explore this world of content without distraction of all possible resources on the internet\(or everyone looking at hit one on google\)  giving a balanced perspective on the matter. 

### Learning Experiences

#### Resources

Every resource may contribute in part to the development of a learners objectives. With so many possible kinds of resources, physical activities, videos, classroom wide exercises and 

#### Assessment

measured engagement, some domains can have correct answers others can be peer assessed and others only by an arbitrator, that understands the student's specific goals.
