Surely it was not always so, we were as a species and as beings born without needing to understand, how can this be? What cataclysm occurred that robbed us of our acceptance of niieve realism. Through the visor of our nature, the intuitive capacity where there is no distinction between perception and directive, everything is clear, reactive; we live in a statically declared weave of functions dictating our responses to the situation before us. Even when we lived in the highly complex environment of the Jungle, the abundence of interconnections and diversity of situations we did just flow through without asserting any order of operations, hierarchies and classifications.
