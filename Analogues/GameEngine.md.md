A game engine is a system for managing the interconnected nature of entities and events within a virtual world where a game takes place. It is a way of managing the flow of artistic resources into a cohesive experience presented through the screen or other device. All while interpreting the commands the user gives in the face of an ever changing state of play. 

When creating games, much of the logic exists to manage interactions and relationships, ensuring that when things come and go from existance that they will be added and removed from the appropriate groups and possible interactions. Jungle modules handle this by nature. 

Games with many states of play or screens can be conceptualised as modes of a cell, that means that although the scope may have a global context, unchanging elements may be left in place. The ability to do so is captured by the notion of hot-swapping,


the game model and the visualisation or stylistic elements of a game engine could be exchanged for others. by concieving of the rendering pipeline as a series of connected modules that could be exchanged and replaced freely, allowing comparitive analysis to become a breeze. 


because the game could be running at once it may be possible to parametrise or tune the game without rebuilding the entire codebase, a panel may be created to monitor certain aspects of the game and provide instantaneous feedback about its difficulty and quality. Such a panel could be operating remotely, or in the same space as an overlay.


it could even be implemented across different platforms by providing the domain specific stuff at the most granular level. The domain synchronicity thereby being managable as progressive specialisation.
