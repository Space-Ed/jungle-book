The Zero-Sum game here is a balance between **Added Complexity** and **Name Collision Risk**

#### Added complexity

If we prioritise the reduction of complexity we would throw all properties in the single spec object, that would in turn mean that more keywords for the specification need to be reserved.

Cell
+ prime
+ dispose

Synth
+ resolve
+ carry

Weave
+ medium names

configurations
    - meta membrane/property
        - existance
        - exposure (mesh/shell)
        - reach (domain visor)
        - limitation (methods filter)
    - synchronization.
    - crux infliction/self infliction.
    - offering state(outer, child, nominalized)
