A dangerous thought this, both for the sake of added scope and indeed for the security of systems and accomodation of artifical intelligences. But also it is a huge opportunity, allowing for democratic systems without intermediary institutions.

The notion comes in some parts.

a) Agents under external control are able to manifest within a space. (Manifestation)
b) Agents within a space are able to influence the crafting of the space. (Influence)
 
Manifestation
in this stage the agents take form within a cell, this occurs through a process of entry, because these agents are not primary constructs they do not have an induction that would allow them direct access to the meta layer. Agents are cells and thus they do have a shell, the shell they present to the context is exposed exclusively in the context. The context then injects contacts onto the shell, according to a watch expression on the mesh designation space. This could include an accessor to some state, an admittence to talk to subcomponents and a way to express intent within the space. This allows extraction of information

Influence
with the above culminating in a way to expreses intent, but how could this intent be active upon the very space that permitted them? the meta membrane can allow action upon the space of creation and at the same time a synchronization contact can allow the structure to be externally reflected. This means actions one way on the synclink are validated and sync the otherway is absolute. The validation taking place is the democratic descision process. By being present in the space we are exposed to a view of the structure and a way to express our vision of the structure.
