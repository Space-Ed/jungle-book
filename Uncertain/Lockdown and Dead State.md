Lockdown has two possible interpretations.

one is that of a blocked status, where any data that is approaching the module should be buffered or rejected while the internal operation is undergoing transformation. This situation may arise when there is a critical piece of missing information "I can't process anything until this request is answered". For example a module may require a live connection to a server to keep a system up to date, therefore before we can contribute more actions we need to resynchronise. 

the other is that of a critical failure of a module, that is a non critical failure of the platform. This might occur at priming, causing a blockage of the construction process. It would perhaps be possible to mark a module as vital, which could prevent setting of alive. 

This could be profoundly important for creating naturally resilient systems that can fail without bringing down the entire system. That will see the exception as a state of being, a sickness for which the encapsulating context may have a cure.

In a visual coding environment, these nodes could go red.

The Uncertainty is whether these two notions are of the same underlying form and can be unified. 

We call these two blocked and sick cells. 

## Blocked

- Crux integration: 
Are all cruxes prevented from entering data or just some? Is this decided by the crux or a cell form modifier. Do the cruxes throw back rejection up the chain or can they wait, this would be a 'blockable' property, does blockable need to be accessible through every contact, such that it can be propogated, indeed is the blockage indicated by propogation through links, so that the request can be contingent on whether it must be synchronous.

- Flushing/Cancelling:
If a system can be blocked by any one process within it, can it decide the time to say "that's enough you're going to be cancelled/reset/killed"

- Level of implementation:
Contact/Crux is outermost then the membrane, being a blocked membrane means that all the Cruxes use the membrane property to decide how their contacts behave. Then there is blocked at the cell level, that can have  the additional effects of blocking static method type interaction, and requires another reference from the crux to the cell so they may adjust effects

## Sick 

- Basic Level: 
sickness would arise when certain constraints upon the construct that are not met in it's prime process or are violated by actions upon it, we would mark the cell as 'sick'. 

- Secondary Level:
the situation where external expectations upon a cell by its context are not met, like failure to expose contacts or respond to some request. That is the cell is 'blamed' for the sickness of the context. 

- Inductive Level: 
the inductive level is that a cell containing any sick cells as denizens will also be sick, unless it is capable of handling. if it reaches a root level, perhaps this is when an exception is thrown. 

### Causes 
The causes of sickness will be as many as the causes for exceptions, whenever we are executing in a context where an exception can happen, like the interaction with context through hooks, the addition or removal of a construct, or thrown back from a request as an error. Any unhandled errors may cause a cell to enter the sick state. 

To further elaborate the exceptions arising from modification of active constructs, issues can be caused by conflict with established constraints around exclusivity, name collision and removal of dependencies.

### Implications

Turning this event of a breach of constraints into a state of invalidity means that it opens the door to changing back. It may not be immediately possible to heal, requiring certain preconditions, it would be possible to choose between making some adjustments through the static interface

When a cell becomes sick, what happens to its connections with the world? is it 'blocked'? does it perhaps still operate under certain conditions(a complex idea, partial failure, how that affects the inductive step is unclear).
