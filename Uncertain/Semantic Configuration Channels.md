# Semantic Configuration Channels.

There are many situations in computer programming where you want to have a diversity of possible models and representations, but cut down on the number of implementations to maintain, especially implementations that are coupled, therefore requiring changes in multiple places to modify or extend. This is the reason why this framework exists in a sense, to create a declarative lubrication layer that is robust to changes at either side. Unfortuneately this means that this essential coupling problem is being forced down to the framework and creates some pressing issues.

 - It is difficult to manage features when they are represented in many places of the implementation. 
 
 - it could be untenable to extend any part of the framework without the designer's understanding. 
 
 Ideally we should be able to define a new way of interacting, using distinct semantics but which is created using only configuration. 
 
 Most pertinently we have the distribution of names within the laterally spanning domain of interconnection. That means in many cases we must. 
 
 There is perhaps the notion of a channel that answers all 
 
 How may the channel 
 - engage with the end context.
 - Translate across a membrane
 - expose to a mesh
 - link through a medium

The suggestion is that co-configuration of Cell, Crux and Medium atop a generic structure should make creation of new interaction modes possible.

Let us discuss the generic parameters that can create a full cycle
#### Cell:
- Foundation: 
   - synth, weave, state, rift..
   - builtin rules.
- Supplement
   - builtin rules.
   - policy about extention/modification
   - methods of form parsing/constructs.

####Crux:
- Foundation
   - Caller, accessor, synchronizer
- Supplement
   - returning
   - synchronicity
   - fussiness
   
#### Medium:
- Foundation
   - Distributive
- Supplement
   - allowed multiplicity.
   - selection of endpoints.
   - compatibility.

if all of these things belong to the same domain of functionality perhaps they need to be applicable at once. 

What if you could give one name to the whole lateral system, and create all of these subconstructs within.
